# TF2SoundRandomizer
 A python script that will create a mod that randomizes TF2 sounds.
 
 Run the start.bat file or run randomizer.py through command prompt. Then copy the output folder into your TF2 custom folder. Works decently well in casual. The downsides in casual are that voice lines and most other player's shooting doesn't make sounds.
